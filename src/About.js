            <p>YogaAsana is a virtual instructor that can respond to the person's movements and provide this useful feedback missing in generic exercise videos. The other features of the portal would include a gamified platform where the profile analytics, and daily streak would be maintained.
There would also be a discussion forum where the users could form groups and share their progress.
